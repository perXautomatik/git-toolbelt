  .SYNOPSIS
  A function to get chunks of paths for trid based on a chunk size and a wildcard match criteria.
  
  .DESCRIPTION
  This function takes an array of paths and a chunk size as parameters and returns an array of chunks of paths for trid. It groups the paths by their parent paths and creates chunks based on the chunk size and the wildcard match criteria. If there are no other files in the group that would be matched by the prefix wildcard, it uses the prefix wildcard as the path for trid. Otherwise, it uses each individual path in the chunk as separate paths for trid.
  
  .PARAMETER Paths
  The array of paths to be chunked.
  
  .PARAMETER ChunkSize
  The maximum number of paths in a chunk for trid.
  
  .EXAMPLE
  Get-TridChunks -Paths @("C:\foo\bar1.txt", "C:\foo\bar2.txt", "C:\foo\baz1.txt", "C:\foo\baz2.txt") -ChunkSize 2
  
  This will return an array of @("C:\foo\bar*", "C:\foo\baz*").
