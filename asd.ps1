.SYNOPSIS
A function to run a search and move files based on their extensions.

.DESCRIPTION
This function uses Search-Everything and trid to search for files that are not gz, webp or gif in the current directory or its subdirectories, excluding .git folders. It then moves the files to a destination drive based on their extensions. It uses multithreading and chunking to speed up the process and reduce the number of calls to trid. If the file extension cannot be determined by trid, it moves the file to a different folder on the same drive.

.PARAMETER DestinationDrive
The drive letter where the files will be moved to. Default is L:.

.PARAMETER OtherFolder
The name of the folder where the files will be moved to if the condition is not met. Default is Other.

.PARAMETER ChunkSize
The maximum number of paths in a chunk for trid. Default is 100.

.EXAMPLE
runx -DestinationDrive M: -OtherFolder Unknown -ChunkSize 50

This will search for files that are not gz, webp or gif in the current directory or its subdirectories, excluding .git folders, and move them to M: drive based on their extensions using multithreading and chunking with a chunk size of 50. If the file extension cannot be determined by trid, it moves the file to M:\Unknown folder.
