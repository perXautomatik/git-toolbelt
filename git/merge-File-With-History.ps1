<#can you write me a powershell script that takes a number of files as input, for each file assume each file belonge to the same git repo; begin block; tag with "before merge", select one of the files (arbitarly, if non specified as parameter) as the target file, process block; for each file; move file to a new folder called merged, rename the file to same name as target file, commit this change with message: original relative path in repo, create a tag with index of the for each, reset the repo hard to the before merge tag. end block; for each tag created with index, do merge this tag to repo, resolve the merge by unioning both of the conflicting files#>
